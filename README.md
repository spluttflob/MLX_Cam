# Simplified MLX90640 Driver
This project contains a simplified driver for the MLX90640 thermal infrared
camera. 

The main camera driver is by **mwerezak** and can be found at 
<https://github.com/mwerezak/micropython-mlx90640>.

Documentation is mostly found as extensive Doxygen style comments in 
`mlx_cam.py` and the pages generated therefrom (coming soon).
